<p>This controller is used in the <tt>AbstractCooler</tt> class to set
the process outlet temperature by manipulating the coolant air flow.</p>
<p>The controller includes a standard Modelica PI controller and a 
saturation limit between zero and a configurable maximum.</p>

<h3>Tuning Procedure</h3>
<p>This controller has been tuned with the Skogestad rules for PI controllers of 
first-order processes.</p>
<p>Running some test runs with the child classes of <tt>AbstractHeatExchangerTest</tt>,
configured with realistic parameters, it was found that in the range of interest of
most variables the process outlet temperature was reduced by 1 K roughly every 
additional 1 L/min of coolant flow. Interpreting this coincidence as a sign of the
heavens, and knowing that feedback will even out any modelling inaccuracies, -1 K/(L/min), 
in SI units 60000 K/(m^3/s), was takes as the value of <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>The value of &tau; (the process time constant) was estimated by considering the
weight and heat capacity of the heat exchangers as provided by IMM, since their steel will 
hold a much larger part of the internal energy compared to the flows, and the heat
capacity of the coolant flow in typical conditions; a value of 10 minutes (600 s)
was found to be an acceptable approximation for &tau;.</p>

<p>The desired response time &tau;<sub>c</sub> was set to 3 minutes, not too aggressive
to avoid variable saturation during transients.</p>
